# Food-Recipe-API
In this project, I created a food catalogue using HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript using TheMealDB API. The application allows for one to view all the meals, search for a meal basing on the available categories, and view all the ingredients used to prepare the meal.

# Tools
javascript, css, html, api, fetch-api.
